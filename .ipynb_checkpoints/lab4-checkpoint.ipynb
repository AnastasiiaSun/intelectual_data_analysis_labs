    "# Decision Trees Classification on Spam Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Overview\n",
    "In this task, we will build a Decision Trees classifier to predict whether an email is spam or not based on its content. We will use a labeled dataset that contains various emails classified as either spam (1) or not spam (0). The goal is to evaluate the model's performance and discuss potential improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "The dataset used for this task is in CSV format and consists of two columns:\n",
    "- **text**: The content of the email.\n",
    "- **spam**: A binary label indicating whether the email is spam (1) or not spam (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Loading\n",
    "We will begin by loading the dataset and inspecting the first few entries to understand its structure. Additionally, we will output the total number of entries loaded to ensure the data is correctly imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the text data by removing any unnecessary characters, handling missing values, and preparing the data for modeling.\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**: Convert the text data into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF vectorization.\n",
    "3. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "4. **Model Training**: Train a Decision Trees classifier using the training data.\n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's accuracy on both the training and testing datasets. A classification report and confusion matrix also are generated to analyze the performance.\n",
    "6. **Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict the spam status of new email samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "- An accuracy score for both training and testing datasets.\n",
    "- A classification report showing precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "- A confusion matrix illustrating the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.\n",
    "- Insights into the model's performance and potential areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "By the end of this task, we will have a functional spam detection model based on a Decision Trees classifier and a better understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. \n"
